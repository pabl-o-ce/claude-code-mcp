# @Folders

> Reference folders as context in Chat & Composer for enhanced AI conversations

You can reference entire folders in Cursor as context. When using `@Folders` with Agent, it attaches a list of all items in the directory, which allows the Agent to search through the contents itself. This gives Agent the ability to explore and analyze the folder's contents independently as needed for the task at hand.
