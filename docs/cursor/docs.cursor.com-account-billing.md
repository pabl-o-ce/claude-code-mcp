> Guide to Cursor billing: manage subscriptions, seats, cycles, and payments through Stripe portal

We use Stripe as our billing and payments provider

### How do I access billing settings?

The billing portal is where you'll manage all aspects of your subscription. You can access it through the [dashboard](https://cursor.com/settings) by clicking the "Billing" button in your account settings. This takes you to a secure portal where you can handle all billing-related tasks.

### What are Cursor's billing cycles?

Billing cycles run on either a monthly or annual basis, starting on the day you subscribe. For Business accounts with multiple seats, we use prorated billing when your team size changes. This means you only pay for the actual time each seat is used within a billing cycle.

### How do team seats work for Business accounts?

Business accounts use a per-seat billing model where each team member requires one seat license. When adding new members mid-cycle, you're only charged for their remaining time in that billing period. Team admins can manage seats directly through the dashboard.

### Can I switch between monthly and annual billing?

Yes you can! Here's how:

### Where can I find my invoices?

All your billing history is available in the billing portal, where you can view and download both current and past invoices.

### Can I get invoices automatically emailed to me?

Currently, invoices need to be downloaded manually from the billing portal. We know this is a hassle, so we're developing automatic invoice emails as a new feature, and once available, you'll be able to opt-in!

### How do I update my billing information?

You can update your payment method, company name, address, and tax information through the billing portal. We use Stripe as our payment processor to ensure secure transactions. Please note that changes to billing information will only affect future invoices - we cannot modify historical invoices.

### How do I cancel my subscription?

You can cancel your subscription directly through the billing portal using the "Cancel subscription" button. Your access will continue until the end of your current billing period.

### I'm having other billing issues. How can I get help?

For any billing-related questions not covered here, please email us at [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com). Include your account details and specific concerns, and our team will help you resolve them quickly!

### Can I get a refund?

You can self-serve a refund by going to the billing portal and clicking on the `Cancel subscription` button. Our self-serve refund policy is as follows:

**EU, UK or Turkey customers**
