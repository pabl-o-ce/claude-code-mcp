# @Link

> Use web content as context by linking to external websites and resources

## Paste Links

In order for Cursor to visit a link before paste the link and you'll see that the link is "tagged"

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/context/@link.png" />
</Frame>

## Remove Links

By default, we automatically parse links and turn them into `@Links` in Chat.
If you prefer to have the link as plain text, click on the link and then click `Unlink`.

You can also paste without formatting (hold `Shift`) to make sure the link is not tagged
