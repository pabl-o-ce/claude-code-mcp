# @Code

> Learn to reference code using @Code symbol and keyboard shortcuts for adding code to Chat or Edit

To reference specific sections of code, you can use the `@Code` symbol.

## Code Preview

Similar to the [`@Files`](/context/@-symbols/@-files) symbol, Cursor will show a preview of the code's content so you can verify that the code you're referencing is the correct one.

## From the Editor

Another way to add code snippets as context is to select the code you want to reference, and click on either "Add to Chat" (`Ctrl/⌘ Shift L`) or "Add to Edit" (`Ctrl/⌘ Shift K`).

These will add the selected code snippet to either the Chat input box or the currently active Cmd K prompt bar.
