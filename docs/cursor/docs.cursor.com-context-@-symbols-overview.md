# Overview

> Overview of all @ symbols available in Cursor for context and commands

In Cursors input boxes, such as in Composer, Chat and Cmd K, you can use @ symbols by typing `@`. A popup menu will appear with a list of suggestions,
and it will automatically filter to only show the most relevant suggestions based on your input.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You can navigate through the list of suggestions using the up/down arrow keys. You can hit `Enter` to select a suggestion. If the suggestion is a category, such as `Files`,
the suggestions will be filtered to only show the most relevant items within that category.
