# Tab vs GitHub Copilot

> Learn how Cursor's code editing capabilities surpass GitHub Copilot with multi-character & instructional edits

## Tab Improvements

The biggest difference is the way Cursor and GitHub Copilot complete code.

GitHub Copilot can insert text at your cursor position. It cannot edit the code around your cursor or remove text.

Cursor can insert text at your cursor, and much more:

* Multi-character edits

* Instruction-based edits

  </Frame>

Further, Cursor has a history of your recent changes in the context window, so it knows what you are trying to do next.

## Migrate from GitHub Copilot

Since Cursor comes by default with GitHub Copilot, you might have GitHub Copilot and Cursor installed at the same time. We recommend turning off GitHub Copilot when you want to use Cursor.

By default, Cursor takes precedence over GitHub Copilot. If you want to use GitHub Copilot, you can [disable Cursor](/tab/overview#copilot-settings) in the settings.
