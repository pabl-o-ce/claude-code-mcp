The metrics dashboard shows usage statistics for your team over the last 30 days:

### Total Usage

View aggregate metrics across your entire team, including total tabs and premium requests used. For teams less than 30 days old, metrics reflect actual usage since team creation, including activity from team members' individual accounts prior to joining.

### Per Active User

See average usage metrics per active user, including tabs accepted, lines of code, and premium requests.

### User Activity

Track both weekly and monthly active user counts.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do I see different request counts in the metrics page versus the team tab?">
    The difference in numbers you're seeing is because the team tab shows requests for the current billing period, while the metrics page shows a rolling 30-day window. We know is can be confusing - we're working on making this clearer in the dashboard.
