# @Summarized Composers

> Reference summarized versions of your previous Composer sessions as context in new conversations

When working on complex tasks in [Composer](/composer), you might want to reference context or decisions from previous conversations. The `@Summarized Composers` symbol allows you to include summarized versions of your previous Composer sessions as context.

This is particularly useful when:

* You have a long Composer session with important context you want to reference
* You're starting a new but related task and want to maintain continuity
* You want to share the reasoning or decisions from a previous session
