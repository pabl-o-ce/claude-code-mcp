# Getting a Request ID

> Learn how to find and share request IDs in Cursor for better technical support and issue reporting

When the Cursor team are investigating a technical issue, sometimes, we may ask you to provide us with a "request ID".

## What is a request ID?

A request ID is a unique identifier that is generated when you submit a request to Cursor. It is a string of characters that is used to identify the request in our internal systems.

It usually follows a randomized format, such as: `8f2a5b91-4d3e-47c6-9f12-5e8d94ca7d23`.

## How do I find a request ID?

<Warning>
  Request IDs are highly limited when Privacy Mode is enabled, so we recommend disabling Privacy Mode when reporting an issue.

  As a reminder, users on a business plan have Privacy Mode enabled by default, by their organization's admin.
</Warning>

You can retrieve a request ID from within Cursor, by running the `Report AI Action` command.

You you can do this by:

1. Opening the command palette `⌘⇧P`
2. Typing `Report AI Action`
3. Selecting the `Report AI Action` option

This will open a new popup, listing your most recent AI actions across Chat, Composer, CMD+K and Tab.

Select the action you want to report, by matching the time and feature the action was used in. Once you select the action, you have the option to copy the request ID to your clipboard. With it copied, you can send it back to us to look into!
