# Migrate from VS Code

> VS Code-based editor with AI features, supporting extension imports and custom configurations

Cursor is a fork of VS Code. This allows us to focus on making the best way to code with AI, while offering a familiar text editing experience.

## Import Extensions, Themes, Settings, and Keybindings

You can import your VS Code configuration into Cursor with one-click. Navigate to `Cursor Settings` > `General` > `Account`.

## Staying Up to Date

We periodically rebase Cursor onto the latest version of VS Code.

## Why Not an Extension?

As a standalone application, Cursor has more control over the UI of the editor, enabling greater AI integration. Some of our features, like Cursor Tab and CMD-K, are not possible as plugins to existing coding environments.

## Settings

You can open Cursor specific settings pane by clicking on the gear button top-right, by pressing `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + J`, or with `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + P` and typing `Cursor Settings`.

You can open VS Code specific settings with `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + P`, and then typing `VS Code Settings`.

## Why is the Activity Bar in Cursor horizontal?

The activity bar is horizontal by default to save room for chat. If you prefer the normal vertical activity bar you can go to the VS Code settings and set `workbench.activityBar.orientation` to `vertical`, and restart Cursor.
