## Creating a team

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up Business plan">
    To create a team, you need to be on the [Business plan](/account/plans).

    If you're setting up a new account, head over to [create team](https://cursor.com/team/new-team). If you're on a Pro plan, you can click the "Upgrade to Business" button in [dashboard](/account/dashboard)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter team details">
    After clicking "New Team", enter the details for the team. You will have to

  </Step>

  <Step title="Invite members">
    After the team is created, you can start inviting members to the team. All
    changes to users are prorated, meaning that we will only charge for the time
    that a user has been a member of the team

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable SSO (optional)">
    After the team is created, you can enable [SSO](/account/teams/sso) for the team for additional security.

## FAQ

### How can I purchase 10 licenses for my company?

Start by creating a team, then invite your team members. We charge based on the amount of users in your team. We don't have a fixed amount of seats, it's prorated as you update team members

### How can I set up a team when I'm not going to use Cursor myself?

We require at least one paid member to create a team. If you are creating the team, we require you to start as a paid member. After you've invited another member to the team, you can assign yourself the [Unpaid Admin role](/account/teams/members). Seat changes are not billed immediately, so you can set up a team, invite a member and change your own role without being charged
