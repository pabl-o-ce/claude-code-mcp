# Research Papers MCP Server Implementation Notes

## Implementation Status

The Research Papers MCP server has been successfully implemented and moved from the playground to production. It's now fully integrated with the Claude Code MCP infrastructure and available in all Claude Code sessions.

## Key Components

1. **API Integration**
   - Semantic Scholar API client with rate limiting and error handling
   - Support for paper search, metadata retrieval, and citation information

2. **Data Storage**
   - File-based storage in JSON format
   - Support for papers, collections, citations, and relations
   - Data persists between sessions
   - Current location: `/Users/williambrown/dev/claude-code/mcp-servers/research-papers/data/`

3. **MCP Interface**
   - Rich set of tools for paper management
   - Support for importing, searching, organizing, and annotating papers

## Technical Details

1. **Storage Implementation**
   - Each paper is stored as a separate JSON file using its ID as filename
   - Collections, citations, and relations are also stored as separate files
   - Repository pattern for data access abstraction

2. **Service Layer**
   - PaperService handles business logic
   - Supports importing papers, managing collections, and handling citations
   - Abstracts API access and storage details from tool handlers

3. **MCP Tool Handlers**
   - Each tool has its own handler with input validation
   - JSON responses follow MCP format requirements
   - Proper error handling at all levels

## Integration

The server is integrated with Claude Code via the `claude-mcp-local` script, which registers it alongside other MCP servers. The `research-papers` server is available through natural language requests to Claude.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Vector Embeddings**
   - Add support for paper embeddings to enable semantic search
   - Store embeddings for titles, abstracts, and full-text

2. **Additional Academic APIs**
   - Add support for more academic sources (arXiv, PubMed, etc.)
   - Create adapters for different API formats

3. **Content Extraction**
   - Add support for extracting content from PDFs
   - Extract sections, figures, tables, and algorithms

4. **Literature Review Generation**
   - Generate summaries of paper collections
   - Compare and contrast multiple papers
   - Identify research gaps

5. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Add support for citation network visualization
   - Visualize paper relationships and topics

## Best Practices for Tool Calls

1. **Importing Papers**
   - For known DOIs or arXiv IDs: Use `import_paper_by_id`
   - For topical searches: Use `search_and_import_papers`

2. **Organizing Papers**
   - Create collections for related papers
   - Use tags for cross-collection organization
   - Set importance levels (1-5) for prioritization

3. **Managing Research Workflow**
   - Update read status as you progress through papers
   - Add notes for key insights and questions
   - Import citations to discover related work

4. **Combining with Other MCP Servers**
   - Use `brave-search` for general web searches
   - Use `fetch` to retrieve additional information about papers
   - Use `memory` to store relationships between concepts across papers
